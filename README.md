# Hotel booking cancellation prediction using Logistic Regression
## Sumitted by: Samruddhi Shishir Patil

**Abstract:**\
The online reservation system is one of the most attractive solutions in the hospitality industry. Cancellation of hotel bookings or reservations through the online system is currently one of the problems in the hotel management system. When the reservation has been canceled, the hotel will be harmed.\
Hence, predicting whether a booking will be cancelled or not using the help of data science is needed so that the hotel can minimize lost profits. Therefore, by using datasets related to hotel booking, a predictive analysis using logistic regression is conducted.

This project-
- analyses the data of the visitors on the basis of the month, seasons, etc.
- predicts the hotel booking cancellations using Logistic regression.

The dataset contains the information of visitors of two hotels over the time period of *July 2015 to August 2017*.

**The flow of the code is as follows:**
1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning
3. Data processing and visualisation
4. Interpretation of results to identify most important features to be considerd. 
5. Model building and prediction.
6. Validation of the algorithm.
